# LLM OS

This project contains an initial implementation of the **LLM OS** proposed by
[Andrej Karpathy][karpathy].
He introduced it [in this post][post1] on [ùïè] and talks more about it in
[this post][post2] and [this video].

## Setup

### Create virtualenv

Create your virtualenv with built-in `venv` package.

```python
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate your environment.

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

Install dependencies using `poetry`.

```sh
poetry install
poetry install --with dev  # for dev
```

### API Keys and Secrets

You have two options to create your API keys: using `.env` file or `streamlit`'s
secrets. Note that you can only use `streamlit` when running the `streamlit` app
locally or when deployed. However, `.env` is advised for local development.

- **Create your secrets with `.env`**

```sh
mv .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file.

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
EXA_API_KEY=c0...
```

<!-- TODO: Use streamlit secrets for API keys. -->
- **Create your secrets & config with `streamlit`**

```sh
mkdir -p ./.streamlit/
touch ./.streamlit/secrets.toml  # for secret keys
touch ./.streamlit/config.toml   # for streamlit config
```

Edit `$CWD/.streamlit/secrets.toml` file.

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "<get API key from platform.openai.com/api-keys>"
NEWS_API_KEY = "<get API key from https://newsapi.org/register>"
```

### Run PgVector

We use `PgVector` to provide long-term memory and knowledge to the LLM OS.
Please install [docker desktop] and run `PgVector` using either the helper script
or the `docker run` command.

[docker desktop]: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

- **Run using a helper script**

```sh
./run_pgvector.sh
```

- **OR run using the docker run command**

```sh
docker run -d \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=ai \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=ai \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ai \
  -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
  -v pgvolume:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5532:5432 \
  --name pgvector \
  phidata/pgvector:16
```

## Usage

Start your `streamlit` application:

```sh
streamlit run home.py
```
